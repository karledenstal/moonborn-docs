  - You can ask her for alchemy ingredients she might've found.
  - You can ask her for any ingredients found from animals.
  - You can ask her for any pelts she might have gotten from hunting.

## Idle dialogue

As per our [philosophy](/reference/philosophy/) of follower creation, we don't have a ton of idle dialogue. You will find some idle dialogue in certain locations though, where we feel it makes more sense. Most of the idle dialogue is when you're out in the world, in dungeons and in cities.

Aela will have idle dialogue in the following locations:

- Solitude
- Whiterun
- Riften
- Windhelm
- Markarth
- Falkreath
- Winterhold
- Dawnstar
- Morthal
- Dragon Bridge
- Ivarstead
- Riverwood
- Rorikstead
- Shor's Stone

## Let's chat

Let's chat is the core functionality of MOONBORN. This is where you will access most of what Aela has to offer. Because we didn't want to make you pause your adventuring, all of the "Let's chat." dialogue is only accessible once you're in an inn. This is to act as a sort of "wind down and relax" after a long day of adventuring together. We also didn't want you to feel like you're missing out on content if you don't talk to her all the time.

Aela will have unique, one-time dialogue in the following inns:

- Winking Skeever (Solitude).
- Sleeping Giant Inn (Riverwood).
- The Frozen Hearth (Winterhold).
- Candlehearth Hall (Windhelm).
- The Bannered Mare (Whiterun).
- Jorrvaskr (Whiterun).
- Dead Man's Drink (Falkreath).
- Windpeak In (Dawnstar).
- Moorside Inn (Morthal).
- Vilmyr Inn (Ivarstead).
- Silver-Blood Inn (Markarth).
- The Bee and Barb (Riften).

She will also have general dialogue for any quest you're currently on, to comment on things are going, what you have seen and done. *This dialogue is available in any inn.*

## Any thoughts?

Whenever you're in an interior cell, there is now the option to ask Aela what she thinks about the place. These are smaller one off lines that are meant to give you a better idea of what Aela thinks about the world around her. The reason these are behind the "Aby thoughts?" line is to avoid her blabbering all the time when you're in more cramped spaces.
