description: The philosophy behind MOONBORN - Aela Expanded.
---

This is our modding philosophy when it comes to MOONBORN - Aela Expanded. This is to give you an idea of what to expect from the mod and what we're trying to achieve with it. As well as give you some insight on why we're doing things the way we are.

## Immersive

Aela should feel part of the game world as your side-kick. This is important, because we don't want to detract from your experience or your character being the *main character*. Aela is simply a companion, a friend and potentially a lover. 

We don't want the player to constantly turn around to talk to her to get her latest thoughts or insight, we don't want her to constantly chat when you're doing something else. We want her to be there to talk when you want to talk to her. This is why the "Let's chat" option is such a core functionality.

You should wake up in an inn and tell her "Good morning". You should go out and adventure all day, only to find yourself back at an inn where you can unwind and chat like friends. You should be able to tell her "Good night" and go to sleep. 

## Natural Progression

Progressing through your relationship with Aela should feel rewarding and natural. We don't want to force a gimmicky "Gifting" option to win her love, we don't want to force you to constantly pay attention to her to progress. We want you to simply engage in the content she offers by talking at inns and doing quests together, and naturally unlock a deeper relationship with her. 

Throughout her dialogue you will find certain dialogue options that will make her like you more, and the more dialogue you uncover, the wheels of romance will be set in motion until you reach a point where you can opt-in or out.

## Partners, not followers

The two points above come together in this final point. At the end of the day, we want it to feel as if your partners, traveling Skyrim and adventuring together. There's no babysitting, no micromanagement, no over-the-top morale system. Just a Harbinger and his lieutenant traveling the world together.
