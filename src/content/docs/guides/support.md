Creating & maintaining this mod is a lot of fun. It's also a lot of work, since we want to deliver the best possible experience for both ourselves and anyone else who might enjoy Aela. The mod is fully available for free and it will *always* be. This mod is simply too great to be locked behind any sort of paywall.

However, if you want to support us and help us improve the mod, you can do so by donating to us. It creates a nice incentive to keep coming back to maintain and support this mod.
