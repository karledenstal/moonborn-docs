Creating & maintaining this mod is a lot of fun. It's also a lot of work, since we want to deliver the best possible experience for both ourselves and anyone else who might enjoy Aela. The mod is fully available for free and it *always* will be. This mod is simply too great to be locked behind any sort of paywall ;).

If you'd like to support and/or help us, there are a few ways you can do so:

- Join our [Discord](#) to leave feedback, report bugs, and chat with us.
- Any volonteer work is always appreciated.
  - We'd like to have translations for the mod and this wiki page in as many languages as possible.
  - Patches for other mods would be welcome to include in our FOMOD.
- You can also subscribe to our [Patreon](#) for special features, early access to updates, and more.

Most importantly, we'd like to thank you for using our mod and (hopefully) enjoying it as much as we do.
