First of all, we don't recommend uninstalling any mod in the middle of a playthrough. We would instead recommend just dismissing Aela as a follower and ignoring her until you're ready to start a new playthrough and uninstalling her before that. You do that by unticking the mod in your mod manager and/or deleting it.

If you insist on uninstalling the mod mid-playthrough, follow these steps:

- [ ] Dismiss Aela as a follower.
- [ ] Go into an interior cell where she is not.
- [ ] Save your game.
- [ ] Uninstall the mod.
- [ ] Load your save.
- [ ] Wait for 24 hours in-game.
- [ ] Save your game.
- [ ] Continue playing.

This is not a fool-proof method. We won't offer any support if uninstalling her mid-playthrough is causing any issues for you. **Do so at your own risk.**
