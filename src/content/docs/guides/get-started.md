description: Get started on using MOONBORN - Aela Expanded.

MOONBORN - Aela Expanded doesn't have any requirements besides `Skyrim Special Edition` and `Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE64)`. However, we do recommend using the following mods to enhance your experience before you download and install **MOONBORN - Aela Expanded**.

## Aela Visual Enhancer

Select an Aela visual enhancer of your choice. Moonborn comes with patches to most of the popular choices, such as:

- [Bijin Warmaidens](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1825)
- [Pandorable's Shield-Sisters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42480)
- [Dibella's Blessing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82606)
- [NITHI NPC Enhancement - The Companions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83270)
- [Northbourne NPCs - Whiterun Hold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35404)
- [High Poly True To Vanilla NPC Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74226)

We recommend [lilson's incredible Dibella's Blessing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82606) for Aela, as it matches the new voice type.

If your favorite Aela visual overhaul isn't included in the list above, don't worry! You can easily create a patch yourself. See [Creating a Patch](/docs/guides/creating-a-patch) for more information. Or you can ask us in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/8XeHg5b) for one and we'll be happy to add it.

## Companions Dialogue Bundle

**MOONBORN** is practically made with [Companions Dialogue Bundle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93592) in mind. It adds a bunch of new dialogue and dialogue options to the Companions, including Aela. It's a must-have for any Companions playthrough.

Of course, both of these "requirements" are completely optional and if you are happy with how your current setup is, then proceed to the next step!
