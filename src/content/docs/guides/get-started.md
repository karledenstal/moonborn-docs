MOONBORN - Aela Expanded doesn't have any requirements besides `Skyrim Special Edition`. However, we do recommend using the following mods to enhance your experience before you download and install **MOONBORN - Aela Expanded**.

## Aela Visual Enhancer

Moonborn comes with it's own visual replacement for Aela by the talented coldsun, but we also have patches for the most popular following visual mods:

- [Bijin Warmaidens](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1825)
- [Pandorable's Shield-Sisters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42480)
- [Dibella's Blessing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82606)
- [NITHI NPC Enhancement - The Companions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83270)
- [Northbourne NPCs - Whiterun Hold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35404)
- [High Poly True To Vanilla NPC Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74226)

If your favorite Aela visual overhaul isn't included in the list above, don't worry! You can easily create a patch yourself. See [Creating a Patch](/docs/guides/creating-a-patch) for more information. Or you can ask us in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/8XeHg5b) for one and we'll be happy to add it.

## Companions Dialogue Bundle

**MOONBORN** is practically made with [Companions Dialogue Bundle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93592) in mind. It adds a bunch of new dialogue and dialogue options to the Companions, including Aela. It's a must-have for any Companions playthrough.

Of course, both of these "requirements" are completely optional and if you are happy with how your current setup is, then proceed to the next step!
