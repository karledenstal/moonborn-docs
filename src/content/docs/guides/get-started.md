Moonborn is a mod created by jakequery and KiaraRedVA. The mod expands on Aela the Huntress' character, adding new dialogue, interaction and making her a fuller character.

## Requirements

Keep in mind that these requirements may have their own requirements. Make sure to read the description of each mod to ensure you have everything you need.

- [Skyrim Special Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/)
- [SKSE64](https://skse.silverlock.org/)
- [PapyrusExtender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)

Before continuing, we do recommend also installing the following mods to enhance your experience with Aela:

## Aela Visual Enhancer

Moonborn comes with it's own visual replacement for Aela, but we also have patches for some of the most popular following visual mods:

If your favorite Aela visual overhaul isn't included in the list above, don't worry! You can easily create a patch yourself. See [Creating a Patch](/docs/guides/creating-a-patch) for more information. Or you can ask us in the Discord for one and we'll be happy to add it.

## Companions Dialogue Bundle

**MOONBORN** is practically made with [Companions Dialogue Bundle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93592) in mind. It adds a bunch of new dialogue and dialogue options to the Companions, including Aela. It's a must-have for any Companions playthrough. Moonborn Aela also adds even more content regarding the Companions, so combining the two should make for a very rich experience.
