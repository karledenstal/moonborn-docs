There shouldn't be any issues updating the mod mid-playthrough. We recommend you update the mod as soon as you see an update is available, as we're constantly fixing bugs and adding new features.

Since the mod is not an *ESPFE (ESL-flagged plugin)*, the updates will not break any Form IDs. We also don't want to make you lose all your progress with Aela, so we're very careful about not breaking anything in updates.
