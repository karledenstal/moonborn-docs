Before you download the mod, we recommend you use a mod manager to install it. We recommend [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194) or [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/?). In our Discord, we support both of these mod managers, but we recommend Mod Organizer 2.

To set up Mod Organizer 2, please follow this [guide by GamerPoets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DEzehXK1TA) (it's not the most up to date, but contains the most information). To set up Vortex, please follow this [guide by Gopher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbOteChLJE&list=PLE7DlYarj-DfYgxma5znKGYEqAHDU_WU-). 

## Download

You can download the mod from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94357). Navigate to the `Files` section and choose the file under `Main files`. No other files are necessary, as the main file contains a FOMOD installer with all the options.

## Install

Double-click the downloaded mod in your preferred mod manager to start the installation. Follow the FOMOD step-by-step. The FOMOD will automatically install the main mod for you, as well as provide patches for NPC replacers ([check previous step](/guides/get-started#aela-visual-enhancer)) and other mods such as [Companions Dialogue Bundle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93592) and [AI Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654).

That should be it for installation. Start up the game and get ready to meet Aela!

## Recruting Aela

Just as the vanilla game, Aela is only available to be recruited once you become the Harbinger of the Companions. So you need to play and complete the Companions questline in order to get her as a follower. We recommend that you do this first thing in your game, so that you have her as a follower through as many quests as possible.
