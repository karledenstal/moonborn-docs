Version 1.3 & Version 1.4 (they might not be two separate versions, we'll see) will focus on polishing up the mod. This means looking over what we currently have and making sure it's up to our standards. This includes:

- [ ] Fixing any bugs that might have been reported.
- [ ] Fixing any typos that might have been reported.
- [ ] Fleshing out any dialogue that might be lacking.
  - [ ] Performance Review system.
  - [ ] Idle dialogues.
  - [ ] Combat dialogues.
- [ ] Adding more dialogue where it makes sense.
- [ ] ...and more.
